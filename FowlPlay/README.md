Hey, um...

This is mine. So don't take any code without credit, unless it's *just* SDL stuff.

If you're reading this I suppose I made this public for whatever reason.

The .exe currently does not work if you do not have the proper thing installed already*, which is obviously problematic.
So don't expect it to work and then tell me it doesn't.

Don't copy bad code and blame me for writing said bad code. 

Also warning there may or may not (**may**) be swearing in comments because I felt like it. 

I'm basically just uploading this so that you can look at the code.

A playable alpha build of the game will release at some point.

Probably.





*It works on my machine...
