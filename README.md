This is the repository for the February Hall of Fame

Here we have the game "Fowl Play: Birds 'n bullets", this game showcaed an early version of the game in which there are chickens that have animations, custom graphics, a reticle where you would shoot, the ability to shoot and a couple of characters. The game is meant to be played with a controller, which is well optimised, even so far as the controller rumbling.
